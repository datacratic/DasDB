    Utilities related to the abort() function.

    These functions are meant to be used as debugging helpers so that the
    program can be stopped as soon as an error is detected. This is mainly
    useful if we can't use "catch throw" in gdb because it would yield too many
    false positives. Instead we just sprinkle several calls to do_abort() and
    let gdb break on SIGABRT.
