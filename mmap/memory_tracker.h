Used to check for memory leaks by tracking allocations and deallocations.

Note that the point of origin of the last allocation can be obtained by
setting backtrace to true during construction. This will slow things
down considerably.

Note that this class should only be used for debugging purposes. It is
completely unoptimized and in a scenario of heavy concurrency, it will spend a
ridiculous amount of time on system calls.
