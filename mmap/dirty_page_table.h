/** Keeps track of pages within the mmap that have been accessed.

    It's used in conjunction with SimpleSnapshot to find what needs to be
    written to disk. It's also a alternative to the original Snapshot class
    which used hardware assisted-kernel trickery to do the same job.
    Unfortunately that part of the linux kernel is fairly buggy.

    This class is entirely lock free except during memory allocations. To make
    up for that, the number of possible calls to malloc is bounded to a constant
    number which is a function of the mmap size. Roughly speaking, we're talking
    20 allocation tops which, if managed correctly, means 20 allocation for the
    entire life-time of the mmap.
