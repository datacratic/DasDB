/** Abstract merging algorithm which is in charge of moving down the trie and

    While the BranchingPoint concept along with the Cursors greatly simplifies
    the merging algorithm, it's still pretty difficult to handle all 3 tries at
    once. So the idea is that we seperate the algorithm in 3 stages that only
    require that we look at 2 tries at any given time. These 3 stages are
    represented by MergeDiff, MergeInsert, MergeRemove.

    This class provides the core mechanism to explore the trie and reduce the
    merging problem to a pair of branching point. Those branching points are
    then given over to the subclasses to be handled however appropriate by the
    given stage of the algorithm.

    Also note that this is a depth first recursion. Since we often need to make
    multiple modifications to a tree, we can be sure any modifications required
    to one of the subtrees will be completed before we modifiy the root of the
    tree. The cursors also have a mechanism (setNode()) to share any node
    changes back up the recursion tree.

/** Gathers all the values inserted in the current trie version.

    This is usefull when we're rolling-back a set of changes in a version and we
    our values are pointers to manually allocated structures. In this case,
    any values that we created in the current version needs to be deallocated.

    This is actually quite similar to the MergeGc algo but it differs in the
    type of values it gathers. MergeGc is interested in nodes and we're
    interested in values.

    \todo MergeBase never uses its GcList and it only requires it as a
    convenience thing for all the other algorithm. This algo doesn't need it
    so...
