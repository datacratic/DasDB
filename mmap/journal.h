    Journaling is done bye a series of calls to addEntry() which keeps track of
    all the items that needs to be written to the disk. A write operation can
    then be comitted to disk by calling applyToTarget(). A partial write to
    the target file can be undoned by calling undo().

    Note that this class is not thread-safe. This means that the memory region
    and the target file should not be modified in any way while journalling.

          data isn't corrupted.
